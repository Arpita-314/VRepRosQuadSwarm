VRepRosQuadControl
==================


Summary
-------

This is a framework to control a series of quad-copters simulated in V-Rep by using ROS publisher/subscribers to completely cover a given terrain. By using the roslaunch files you can configure how many robots you want to use for the coverage.
The terrain to be covered is given as input to the executables which start with the "quad" prefix and is represented as a binary occupancy grid (e.g. zero for accessible point, 1 for not accessible point).
All the algorithms are publishing the positions to be followed on ROS topic that are read by the V-Rep simulator using the *.ttt scenes provided in the package.

Compiling and running
=====================

To build the following package you will need [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS) to be installed and clone this repository in the src of a new [catkin package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/catkin/CreatingPackage).
**Important**: it is reccomended to use use **ROS Hydro** because Indigo causes issues with V-REP.
To use the scenarios (the *.ttt files) you have to install V-Rep, available from the [Coppelia Robotics](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) website.

How to run
----------
**1.** Copy the folder "quadcopter\_ctrl" inside the catkin source folder (*catkin_ws/src*).

**2.** Compile once with `catkin_make`.

**3.** Create the necessary folders to create the following path:

*catkin_ws/devel/lib/quadcopter_ctrl/Input/Grids*
     
Inside this folder create a file (for example "map_file.txt") containing a binary occupancy matrix, for example:
```
    0 0 0 0 
    0 0 1 1
    0 0 1 1
    0 0 0 0
```
That represents a map with a square obstacle on the right.

**4.** Now launch `roscore` in a terminal, and V-REP in another terminal.

**5.** In V-REP open the scene *3Rob_freeEnvironm.ttt* (it's in the root of the repository).

**6.** In a third terminal use one of the roslaunch file to run a coverage, using as input the file that you created before, for example:
```
$ roslaunch quadcopter_ctrl swarmNodeCount_3.launch input:=map_file.txt
```
**7.** Now the quadcopter should start performing the coverage in V-REP.

Details
=======

The are five algorithms developed, that can be divided in two areas: offline and online algorithms.


Offline Algorithms
------------------

Paths generated offline, before quad-copters start moving:

1. VRP Greedy using Floyd-Warshall

2. VRP Greedy using Floyd-Warshall


In quadcopterRosCtrl.cpp, you can choose which of the two algorithm to use by editing the declared class in the main. Quadcopters follow some paths generated by the Greedy Algorithm run in kernelNode, which solves the Vehicle routing problem using the VRPGreedy class to cover all the environment simulated in V-Rep.


Online Algorithms
-----------------

Paths generated online while robots are moving:

1. Node Counting

2. Learning Real-Time A*

3. PatrolGRAPH*


In quadNodeCount.cpp the path is generated using the NodeCount class to find the nearest node with the smallest number of visits. Visit count maps are updated in a callback function using a topic common to all the quadcopter-controller-nodes running, named "updateNodeCount". The quadLRTA.cpp has a similar behaviour.
