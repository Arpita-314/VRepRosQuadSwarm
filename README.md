VRepRosQuadControl
==================

Summary
-------

This is a framework to control a series of quadcopters simulated in Vrep by using ROS publisher/subscribers.

Compilation
-----------

To build the following package you will need [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS) to be installed and clone this repository in the src of a new [catkin package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/catkin/CreatingPackage). (section in progress - further explanation will be added)


Details
-------

The are two algorithms developed:

1) VRP Greedy (paths generated offline before start)

2) Node Counting (paths generated online while robots are moving)

1.
In quadcopterRosCtrl.cpp, quadcopters follow some paths generated by a Greedy Algorithm run in kernelNode, which solves the Vehicle routing problem using the VRPGreedy class to cover all the environment simulated in Vrep.

2.
In quadNodeCount.cpp the path is generated using the NodeCount class to find the nearest node with the smallest number of visits. Visit count maps are updated in a callback function using a topic common to all the quadcopter-controller-nodes running, named "updateNodeCount".
